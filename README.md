## Classification with Transfer Learning

A project where i got decent accuracy in very few epochs using transfer learning. I have extended the idea of coursera guided project **Classification with Transfer Learning in Keras** to implement the same classification model using relatively less amount of data-set, using famous inception network. I have done image augmentation and drop backs to manage high accuracy with regularization effect. The link of course certificate is given below:
